# Solana Portfolio Tracker

**Vercel Deployment** â€“ https://portfolio-solana.vercel.app/

Tried to build something similar to [portfolio.jup.ag](https://portfolio.jup.ag) with my own structure and approach.

A Solana portfolio dashboard to view token holdings, net worth, and recent transactions for any wallet or `.sol` domain.

## Usage

You can either enter your wallet address or a `.sol` domain (for example: `idrawline.sol`) to view the dashboard.

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies before starting development.

## Scope for Improvement

- Better UI with a spam list in the holdings table.
- Add a chart to view historical net worth (similar to AssetDash).
- Show a spam transaction icon in the recent transactions table.
